# Neovim from scratch

## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

**IMPORTANT** requires `Neovim 0.7 release` version
```
https://github.com/kotoldadas/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim) 

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```
  sudo apt install xsel
  ```

- On Arch Linux

  ```
  sudo pacman -S xsel
  ```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```
  npm i -g neovim
  ```
---

## Debugging

# Python
```
mkdir .virtualenvs
cd .virtualenvs
python -m venv debugpy
debugpy/bin/python -m pip install debugpy
```

**NOTE** make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, I recommend a node manager like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).
